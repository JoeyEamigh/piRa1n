# piRa1n

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
If you use piRa1n, please note that I am in no way responsible for any damage to your devices.

## How does it work?
piRa1n jailbreaks your iDevice using [Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/).

Connect the Raspberry Pi 4/Banana pi M2 Zero to a powerbank. After that, plug you iDevice to the Pi. Put the iDevice in DFU mode and let piRa1n do the rest!
