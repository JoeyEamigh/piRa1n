# piRa1n
piRa1n lets you easily turn a Raspberry Pi 4 or a Banana pi M2 Zero into a portable Checkra1n dongle.

**This only works with a Raspberry Pi 4! Other versions of the Raspberry Pi are not supported. It also works with a Banana pi M2 Zero.**

If you use piRa1n, please note that I am in no way responsible for any damage to your devices.
I recommend to make an [iCloud/iTunes backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) before jailbreaking your device.
