# piRa1n
piRa1n lets you easily create a portable Checkra1n dongle with a Raspberry Pi 4 or a Banana pi M2 Zero.\
[Here](https://youtu.be/lqGb8SG-VII) is a demo of piRa1n.

**This only works with a Raspberry Pi 4! Other versions of the Raspberry Pi are not supported. It also works with a Banana pi M2 Zero, thanks to [u/gilshahar7](https://www.reddit.com/user/gilshahar7/).**

## [Instructions on how to use piRa1n](https://github.com/raspberryenvoie/piRa1n/wiki)

## How does it work?
piRa1n jailbreaks your iDevice using [Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/).\
Connect the Raspberry Pi 4/Banana pi M2 Zero to a powerbank. After that, plug you iDevice to the Pi, put it in recovery mode, then in DFU mode and let piRa1n do the rest!

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
If you use piRa1n, please note that I am in no way responsible for any damage to your devices.
I recommend to make an [iCloud/iTunes backup](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT203977) before jailbreaking your device.
