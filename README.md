# piRa1n
If you want to jailbreak your iDevice and you do not have access to your computer, you can create your own box with a Raspberry Pi 4 and carry it anywhere, you just have to connect it to a power bank.

**This only works with a Raspberry Pi 4! Other versions of the Raspberry Pi will not work.**

## How does it work?
piRa1n jailbreak your iDevice using [Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/).

Connect the Raspberry Pi 4 to a powerbank. After that, plug you iDevice to the Pi. Put the iDevice in DFU mode and let piRa1n do the rest!

## Parts list
- a Raspberry Pi 4 with either 2GB, 4GB of RAM (2GB of RAM is enough and cheaper so I recommend the 2GB version).
- a USB to USB Type-C cable.\
- a USB to lightning cable.\
- a powerbank
- a MicroSD Card of at least 8GB
