# piRa1n
piRa1n lets you easily turn a Raspberry Pi 4 or a Banana pi m2 zero into a portable Checkra1n dongle.\
[Here](https://youtu.be/lqGb8SG-VII) is a demo of piRa1n.

**This only works with a Raspberry Pi 4! Other versions of the Raspberry Pi are not supported. It also works with a Banana pi M2 Zero, thanks to [u/gilshahar7](https://www.reddit.com/user/gilshahar7/).**
